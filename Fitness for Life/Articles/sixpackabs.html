<p class="numbers">1. Cut down on refined carbohydrates</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
    
        <a>Eating many refined carbohydrates can cause blood sugar blockages, which can lead to increased hunger and food intake.</a>
<br></br>
<a>
    Refined carbohydrates lose most of their vitamins, minerals, and fiber during processing, ending in an end product with low nutritional value.</a>
<br></br>
    <a>Eating a lot of whole grains, on the other hand, has been linked to reduced waist size and reduced body weight.</a> 
<br></br>
<a>Some studies found that people who eat many refined grains tended to have more body fat than those who ate more whole grains.</a>
<br></br>
<a>Change refined carbohydrates from foods such as sweets and processed foods, and eat whole grains like rice, vegetables, bulgur, and couscous instead to help keep you full and to burn.</a>
</div>




    <br></br>
<p class="numbers">2. Drink more water</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
      
   <a> Water is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. It plays a role in everything from waste removal to temperature regulation.</a>
<br></br>
<a>Staying hydrated can help boost your metabolism, burn extra abdominal fat, and make it easier to get six-pack abs.</a>
<br></br>
<a>Water requirements can vary based on various factors, such as height, body weight, age, and activity level.</a>
<br></br>
<a>A study found that 500 milliliters of water temporarily increased energy expenditure by 25% for up to 60 minutes after eating.</a>
<br></br>
<a>Other studies show that drinking water can also increase weight loss and reduce appetite.</a>
<br></br>
<a>A study of 48 older and middle-aged adults found that people who drank water before each meal lost 44% more weight over 12 weeks than those who did not.</a> 
</div>
<br></br>
<p class="numbers">3.Master the plank</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
    
    <a>The plank, and its variations, is one of the best exercises you can do for your core.</a>
      <br></br>
    <a>The basic move can seem easy: after all, it seems like you're just holding a pushup position with your weight resting on your forearms or hands.</a>
<br></br>
<a>"The plank is only easy if you hurt it or don't know how to make it more difficult," said Wunsch. Also, he adds, the table is essential because it teaches you how to harden your heart. "It's a skill you need for almost any exercise."</a>
<br></br>
<a>So how do you master this exercise? Focus on tightening your heart and glutes to activate your muscles and keep your spine aligned.  You can try more variations of this exercise, for example, you can do this using only one foot or only one hand. </a>

  <br></br>
<div class="pause">
 


</div>
<p class="numbers">4.Eat more protein</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
    
    <a>Protein helps build muscle, but it's important to choose higher-fat options. These fish, poultry, legumes,  eggs, nuts, and full-fat dairy products. Go for these instead of processed meats, like bacon.</a>
<br></br>
<a>The right amount of protein per day depends on your body weight,height, and activity level. In general, go for at least 5  to 6 oz (160 to 180 g) per day. </a>
<br></br>
<a>For example, have 4 oz (110 g) of grilled chicken over a salad for lunch, and 3 ounces (85 g) of salmon for dinner.
The more active you are, the more protein you need.</a>
</div>
<br></br>
<p class="numbers">5.Lift heavy</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
    
   <a> Do some strength training at least four to five days a week to increase overall muscle mass and focuses on full-body moves. Building muscle helps you burn calories more efficiently, resulting in more abs definition. And, since lifting sessions also raise your heart rate, they are like cardio.</a>
<br></br>
<a>Compound movements like squats, bench press, deadlift, etc. are very good for abs. Especially if you use heavyweight. If you don't have access to a gym membership to use weights you can do exercises like the pushups and the pull-up, which are also good for the abs.</a>
</div>
<br></br>
<p class="numbers">6.Don't do only crunches</p>
<br></br>
<div class="info">
    
    <a>Crunches are a good ab exercise. But it trains only the upper part of your body. If you want to get a nice looking six-pack, you need to do exercises for your lower abdominal area. The leg raise for example is a very good exercise for your lower abs.</a>
<br></br>
<a>You also need to train your obliques. The obliques are located on the outer surface of the sides of the abdomen, on each side of the abs. The obliques are responsible for the twisting of the trunk.</a>  
<br></br>
<a>Do exercises like the side crunch, or the side plank, to train your obliques. If they are looking good, your whole core will look better.</a>
